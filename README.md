# 🏎️ Racing Valley - backend 🏎️

Racing Valley is a portfolio project where you can rent racecars and compare reviews of Vendors that rent out those racecars. As a Vendor you can also add new cars that you rent out, so you can earn more income with your own cars.

## Goals for this Project

The goal of this project is to build a full-stack app, implementing backend and frontend technologies.
This is the backend of the project, where I am trying to:

- build a working prototype in two weeks
- apply the technologies I learned in Codaisseur Bootcamp
- showcase and document development skills using:
  - data model design
  - kanban project approach
  - transparant and structured git version control

## User Stories

- As a **lurker** I want to be able to look at the homepage of the app and see a list of racecars that are for rent so I can see which racecars I can rent.
- As a **lurker** I want to be able to filter the list based on the brand of a racecar so I can see if the racecar I want to rent is availabe.
- As a **lurker** I want to be able to register an account so I can either rent a racecar or to offer my own racecars for rent.
- As a **racer** I want to be able to login to the website so I can book a racecar that I want to rent.
- As a **racer** I want to be able to view my bookings in my own profile page so I can see the details of my booking.
- As a **racer** I want to be able to view a vendors page so I can get more info about this vendor, for example:
  - The racecars he has that are for rent
  - On what racetracks he can deliver these cars
- As a **racer** I want to be able to rate vendors so other racers and lurkers can see which vendors are reliable.
  - I should be able to add a review to the vendor on his public profile page
  - I should be able to see the rating (number of 'stars') of a vendor on the overview page of vendors
- As a **vendor** I want to be able to login and view my dashboard so I can see all my bookings.
- As a **vendor** I want to be able to visit my dashboard and look at the list of my own racecars.
- As a **vendor** I want to be able to (on my dashboard) look at the details of each booking so I know which car needs to be ready for racing.
- _planned:_ As a **vendor** I want to be able to see data concerning the amount of income I generated from this website in a certain amount of time so I know how well my business is going. For example:

  - Total income
  - Income per month (in a chart)
  - Earnings per car
  - Most booked car

## Technologies Used

- Express
- REST API
- Sequelize ORM
- PostgreSQL

## Git Version Control

In this project I try to implement solid version control:

- write clear commit messages
- name branches by features
- do pull requests

## Sample requests with httpie

To demo making request to this server, bash commands are included that make requests using `httpie`

## SETUP Getting started instructions

1. Clone the app
2. install dependencies

```
npm install
```

3. Run migrations & seed data

`package.json` contains a script for this

```bash
npm run initdev
```

Or run the commands seperately

```bash
npx sequelize-cli db:migrate
npx sequelize-cli db:seed:all
```

4. start server with `nodemon` (recommended for development)

```
npm run dev
```

5. or start normally

```
npm start
```
