## Goals for this project

The goal of this project is to build a full-stack app, using both frontend and backend technologies. In this frontend repository I tried to:

- Build a working prototype in less than 2 weeks;
- Apply what we learned during Codaisseur's bootcamp;
- Showcase and document development skills using:
  - wireframes as Minimum Viable Product
  - user stories perspective
  - agile/kanban approach
  - transparant and structured git version control

## User stories

- As a **lurker** I want to be able to look at the homepage of the app and see a list of racecars that are for rent so I can see which racecars I can rent.
- As a **lurker** I want to be able to filter the list based on the brand of a racecar so I can see if the racecar I want to rent is availabe.
- As a **lurker** I want to be able to register an account so I can either rent a racecar or to offer my own racecars for rent.
- As a **racer** I want to be able to login to the website so I can book a racecar that I want to rent.
- As a **racer** I want to be able to view my bookings in my own profile page so I can see the details of my booking.
- As a **racer** I want to be able to view a vendors page so I can get more info about this vendor, for example:
  - The racecars he has that are for rent
  - On what racetracks he can deliver these cars
- As a **racer** I want to be able to rate vendors so other racers and lurkers can see which vendors are reliable.
  - I should be able to add a review to the vendor on his public profile page
  - I should be able to see the rating (number of 'stars') of a vendor on the overview page of vendors
- As a **vendor** I want to be able to login and view my dashboard so I can see all my bookings.
- As a **vendor** I want to be able to visit my dashboard and look at the list of my own racecars.
- As a **vendor** I want to be able to (on my dashboard) look at the details of each booking so I know which car needs to be ready for racing.
- _planned:_ As a **vendor** I want to be able to see data concerning the amount of income I generated from this website in a certain amount of time so I know how well my business is going. For example:

  - Total income
  - Income per month (in a chart)
  - Earnings per car
  - Most booked car

## Git version control

I recognize the need for solid version control and try to:

- write clear commit messages
- name branches by feature
- do pull requests

## Backend server repo

The backend side of this project is an Express server using Sequelize to manage the underlying Postgres database. [Click here for more details](https://github.com/robinrbh/racing-valley-server)
